# Next.js 15 Server Component Dynamic Import Issue in Layouts

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to dynamic imports within server components used as layouts.  When a dynamic import path depends on a route parameter that's not immediately available during server-side rendering (SSR), the import might fail silently, causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior in the client, especially in edge environments.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to a route that uses the layout (e.g., `/page1`).
5. Observe the error (or unexpected behavior) in the browser's console or network tab.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the route parameter is available before attempting the dynamic import.  This often involves using techniques like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` in pages that use the layout to prefetch or provide the necessary parameter.
